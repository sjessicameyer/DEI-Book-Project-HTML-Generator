    <p>"This book is about a little kid who wants to be a mermaid and dress up, it’s shows kids they can express themselves however they want and it’s more than okay to be themselves. It’s not specifically about any identity or anything, just it’s okay to be you :) It has amazing art and is just a sweet book. " -LPS 10th grader      </p>

    <div class="title">Year of the Rat and Year of the Dog</div>
    <p>"This was the first book that I read in elementary school that mirrored by life experience up until that point. I carried it around with me wherever I went because she narrated the story so beautifully and it was her true life experience- the ups, the downs, the real moments. The Year of the Dog is a children’s novel by Grace Lin which follows the journey of young Pacy as she attempts to figure out who she is over the course of the Chinese Year of the Dog. When the novel begins, Pacy and her family –Taiwanese/Chinese-Americans living in New Hartford, New York – celebrate the Chinese New Year, which will serve to be the Year of the Dog. Such a year is meant to be full of good luck, family, wealth, and friendships ... Pacy comes to realize that the Year of the Dog was fantastic after all, not just for friends, family, and wealth, but because Pacy now knows who she is and what she wants to do with her life." -LPS 12th grader      </p>

    <div class="title">Amina's Voice by Hena Khan</div>
    <p>"[Amina's voice] is about a girl named Amina, who has never been comfortable in the spotlight. She is happy just hanging out with her best friend, Soojin. Except now that she’s in middle school everything feels different. Soojin is suddenly hanging out with Emily, one of the “cool” girls in the class, and even talking about changing her name to something more “American.”  I can relate to this book because life can change when you start middle school, with your friends growing up and becoming mature, leaving you behind in the dust. (or maybe you're the one doing the growing up?) This book shows you these changes through the eyes of Amina, who doesn't know if she should change to, or hide who she is to fit in." -LPS 8th grader      </p>
