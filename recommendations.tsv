Julian is a Mermaid	This book is about a little kid who wants to be a mermaid and dress up, it’s shows kids they can express themselves however they want and it’s more than okay to be themselves.

George by Alex Gino (and its sequel, Rick, by the same author) 	I think kids should be exposed to more diverse literature at an earlier age, and this book is an LGBTQ+ book written by an LGBTQ+ author.	9th	1LbtC011GO72TaSuTekT3Q3OAevogCkJ8	a	
Year of the Rat and Year of the Dog	This was the first book that I read in elementary school that mirrored by life experience up until that point. I carried it around with me wherever I went because she narrated the story so beautifully and it was her true life experience- the ups, the downs, the real moments. The Year of the Dog is a children’s novel by Grace Lin which follows the journey of young Pacy as she attempts to figure out who she is over the course of the Chinese Year of the Dog. When the novel begins, Pacy and her family –Taiwanese/Chinese-Americans living in New Hartford, New York – celebrate the Chinese New Year, which will serve to be the Year of the Dog. Such a year is meant to be full of good luck, family, wealth, and friendships ... Pacy comes to realize that the Year of the Dog was fantastic after all, not just for friends, family, and wealth, but because Pacy now knows who she is and what she wants to do with her life.	12th	1rlFX6VL7GtmmHphCg_yw9AO1nTpnPW4Y	a	TRUE
I Promise - LeBron James	It shows diversity and promotes community. "This picture book by basketball superstar LeBron James proposes promises that children can take on, including to attend school and listen to their teachers, to ask questions, to persist, to try their best, to be helpful and respectful to others, promises James says were inspired by "the big dreams of kids in my hometown and around the world."

Amina's Voice by Hena Khan	[Amina's voice] is about a girl named Amina, who has never been comfortable in the spotlight. She is happy just hanging out with her best friend, Soojin. Except now that she’s in middle school everything feels different. Soojin is suddenly hanging out with Emily, one of the “cool” girls in the class, and even talking about changing her name to something more “American.”  I can relate to this book because life can change when you start middle school, with your friends growing up and becoming mature, leaving you behind in the dust. (or maybe you're the one doing the growing up?) This book shows you these changes through the eyes of Amina, who doesn't know if she should change to, or hide who she is to fit in.	8th	1savr_sxOQ8-nbVTYvClE5MHFpqkYCFsc	a

Drawn Together - Minh Lê	The art is not only really eye-catching but I really adore the overall story. I feel as an Asian-American that many others in my position are becoming more and more distant from their asian heritage. This highlights and recognizes that gap while also encouraging for exploration. 	8th	1Fb3l4t6MRARkhqEMCxGz75W81pLO09r5	a
